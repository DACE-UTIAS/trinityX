There exists a wrapper for submitting jobs to slurm which wraps up the
[[sbank-balance]] statement and checkscript commands before running
sbatch.

The primary advantage of this wrapper script is that for un-experienced
users, they only need to know that [[sbank-submit]] will tell them at
submission time whether their jobs are likely to complete or not.

	sbank submit -s sample-job1.sh 
	log: Getting balance for jtang
	User             Usage |          Account       Usage | Account Limit   Available (CPU hrs)
	---------- ----------- + ---------------- ----------- + ------------- -----------
	jtang               20 |            TCHPC          32 |       315,360     315,328
	log: Checking script before submitting
	warn: no account specified in the script, using default: tchpc
	Current balance      =    315,328
	Requested hours      =      3,072
	Expected balance     =    312,256
	log: sbatch'ing the script
