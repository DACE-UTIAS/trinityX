There will be times when you will need to figure out how many CPU hours
you need to see if it exceeds the available hours in your account balance.

This can be done with using the [[sbank-time]] estimate command.

Assuming that you wish to run a 64 node job with 2 cores per node,
that's 128 cores for 72hrs of wall time

	$ sbank time estimate  -N 64 -c 2 -t 72
	9216

Or you want to run 256 tasks for 48hrs

	$ sbank time estimate  -n 256 -t 48
	12288

You can also use [[sbank-time]]'s helper function 'estimatescript'
to check the job script that you have 

	$ sbank time estimatescript -s sample-job1.sh
	3072

Where the contents of *sample-job1.sh*

	#!/bin/bash

	#SBATCH -n 32
	#SBATCH -t 4-00:00:00

	echo "HELLO WORLD"
