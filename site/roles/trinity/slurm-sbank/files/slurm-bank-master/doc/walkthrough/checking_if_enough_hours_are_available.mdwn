Once you have an estimate of how much time you require you might want
to check if you really have enough hours to run your job

[[sbank-balance]] request can give you an idea if you have time or not,
what the [[sbank-balance]] request command returns is the number of
available hours after a request has been made. It does not do anything
apart from print a number. If it returns a negative number then you do
not have enough hours to run.

	$ sbank balance request -c chuck -a tchpc -t 100 -u
	315260

Or else if you want to script things up to be efficient/lazy you can
use some of the helper scripts such as [[sbank-time]].

	$ sbank balance request --cluster chuck --account tchpc \
		--time $( sbank time estimate -n 32 -t \
		$( sbank time calc -t 4-00:00:00 ))

If you want more more details this command can be run with the -v flag

	$ sbank balance request -v --cluster chuck --account tchpc \
		--time $( sbank time estimate -n 32 -t \
		$( sbank time calc -t 2000-00:00:00 ))
		
	Current balance      =    315,326
	Requested hours      =  1,536,000
	Expected balance     = -1,220,674  <= warning: job won't run sucessfully

You can also feed [[sbank-balance]] a job script to see if the script's
request can be completed or not

	$ sbank balance checkscript -s sample-job1.sh  -t myaccount
	312288

The above command returns the remaining balance of your specified account
on the current cluster. If a negative value is returned, then your job
will most likely not complete if it is submitted.
