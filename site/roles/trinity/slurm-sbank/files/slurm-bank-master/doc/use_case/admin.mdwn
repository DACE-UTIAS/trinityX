### What the admin *David* needs to know

The admin David will need to far more than the user. David will
need to decide on some policies and allocations. Create projects
with [[sbank-project]] and add people to projects with [[sbank-project]].

Once the projects have been created David will need to deposit hours
to projects using [[sbank-deposit]].

David could also check the balances of all accounts and users with
`sbank balance statement -A`
